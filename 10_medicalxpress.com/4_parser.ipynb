\\n<p>\\n</p><p>The large-language model (LLM) artificial intelligence chatbot performed equally well in both <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/primary+care/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">primary care</a> and emergency settings across all medical specialties. The research team\\'s results are published in the <i>Journal of Medical Internet Research</i>.\\n</p><p>\"Our paper comprehensively assesses <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/decision+support/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">decision support</a> via ChatGPT from the very beginning of working with a patient through the entire care scenario, from differential diagnosis all the way through testing, diagnosis, and management,\" said corresponding author Marc Succi, MD, associate chair of innovation and commercialization and strategic innovation leader at Mass General Brigham and executive director of the MESH Incubator.\\n</p><p>\"No real benchmarks exists, but we estimate this performance to be at the level of someone who has just graduated from medical school, such as an intern or resident. This tells us that LLMs in general have the potential to be an augmenting tool for the practice of medicine and support <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+decision/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">clinical decision</a> making with impressive accuracy.\"\\n</p><p>Changes in artificial intelligence technology are occurring at a fast pace and transforming many industries, including <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">health care</a>. But the capacity of LLMs to assist in the full scope of clinical care has not yet been studied.\\n</p><p>In this comprehensive, cross-specialty study of how LLMs could be used in clinical advisement and decision making, Succi and his team tested the hypothesis that ChatGPT would be able to work through an entire clinical encounter with a patient and recommend a diagnostic workup, decide the clinical management course, and ultimately make the final diagnosis.\\n</p><p>The study was done by pasting successive portions of 36 standardized, published clinical vignettes into ChatGPT. The tool first was asked to come up with a set of possible, or differential, diagnoses based on the patient\\'s initial information, which included age, gender, symptoms, and whether the case was an emergency.\\n\\n                                            <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->\\n    </p><div class=\"w-100 mb-4 d-print-none\">\\n        <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\\n        <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0536483524803400\" data-ad-slot=\"7099578867\"></ins>\\n        <script>\\n             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n        </script>\\n    </div>                                        <p>ChatGPT was then given additional pieces of information and asked to make management decisions as well as give a final diagnosis—simulating the entire process of seeing a real patient.\\n</p><p>The team compared ChatGPT\\'s accuracy on differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and management in a structured blinded process, awarding points for correct answers and using linear regressions to assess the relationship between ChatGPT\\'s performance and the vignette\\'s demographic information.\\n</p><p>The researchers found that overall, ChatGPT was about 72% accurate and that it was best in making a final diagnosis, where it was 77% accurate. It was lowest-performing in making differential diagnoses, where it was only 60% accurate. It was only 68% accurate in clinical management decisions, such as figuring out what medications to treat the patient with after arriving at the correct <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diagnosis/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">diagnosis</a>.\\n</p><p>Other notable findings from the study included that ChatGPT\\'s answers did not show gender bias and that its overall performance was steady across both primary and emergency care.\\n</p><p>\"ChatGPT struggled with <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/differential+diagnosis/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">differential diagnosis</a>, which is the meat and potatoes of medicine when a physician has to figure out what to do,\" said Succi. \"That is important because it tells us where physicians are truly experts and adding the most value—in the early stages of patient care with little presenting information, when a list of possible diagnoses is needed.\"\\n</p><p>The authors note that before tools like ChatGPT can be considered for integration into clinical care, more benchmark research and regulatory guidance is needed.

and collaborators from U.S., Denmark and Iceland, reported today in <i>JAMA</i> how they employed AI to develop a protein score to predict major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (ASCVD).\\n                                                </p><div class=\"article-banner first-banner ads-336x280\">\\n            <!-- /4988204/MedX_Story_InText_Box -->\\n            <div

13,500 Icelanders who had not experienced major ASCVD before plasma sampling and over 6,000 participants in the FOURIER trial who had suffered ASCVD before plasma sampling. All of these samples had measurements of the levels of around 5,000 <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/plasma+proteins/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">plasma proteins</a> measured with the SomaScan platform.\\n</p><p>The protein risk score, which is solely based on proteomics data from a single plasma sample, predicts ASCVD events well in the absence of information on <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+history/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">medical history</a> and <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">risk factors</a>. A large part of the risk captured by the proteins is also captured by established risk factors, however, the protein score captures additional risk.\\n</p><p>What is more, the protein risk score is a dynamic measure and as such has the potential of being modified upon treatment unlike some of the classic risk factors that are immutable, such as family history and prior ASCVD events. This dynamic feature of protein risk scores, that the levels of proteins rise and fall as a function of time to and from events, makes it well-suited to predict the timing of events.\\n</p><p>As a result, protein risk scores could become an important tool in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">clinical trials</a> to get an early assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic intervention or for monitoring risk.\\n</p><p>\"We believe that in the proteomic risk score, we may have a biomarker that will allow the world to conduct shorter clinical trials with fewer participants. This is going to make the development of new medicines less expensive and make them available sooner for those who need them. Furthermore, in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+practice/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">clinical practice</a> it may allow for more effective prevention of ASCVD,\" said Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE genetics and one of the senior investigators of the study.\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    Hannes Helgason et al, Evaluation of Large-Scale Proteomics for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events, <i>JAMA</i> (2023).  <a data-doi=\"1\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.13258\" target=\"_blank\">DOI: 10.1001/jama.2023.13258</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"mt-3\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>Journal information:</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/journals/journal-of-the-american-medical-association/\"><cite>Journal of the American Medical Association</cite></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"icon_open\" href=\"http://jama.ama-assn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<use href=\"https://medx.b-cdn.net/tmpl/v6/img/svg/sprite.svg#icon_open\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"d-inline-block text-medium my-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeCODE genetics\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                                                                                                        \\n                                        <!-- print only -->\\n                                        <div class=\"d-none d-print-block\">\\n                                            <div class=\"mb-4\">\\n                                                 <strong>Citation</strong>:\\n                                                 Protein score, from a single plasma sample, predicts atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (2023, August 22)\\n                                                 retrieved 23 August 2023\\n                                                 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-protein-score-plasma-sample-atherosclerotic.html\\n                                            </div>\\n                                            <div class=\"border text-muted p-3\">\\n                                            This document is subject to copyright.

disability of osteoarthritis in 2020.\\n</p><p>For people aged 70 and older, osteoarthritis ranked seventh in causes for years lived with disability.\\n</p><p>The condition is expected to increase by 2050 by 74.9% in knees, 48.65% in hands, 78.6% in hips and 95.1% in other joints, including the elbow and shoulder.\\n</p><p>Osteoarthritis impacts women more than men, and that\\'s expected to continue to be true.\\n</p><p>In 2020, 61% of osteoarthritis cases were in women compared to 39% in men.\\n</p><p>\"The reasons for <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gender+differences/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">gender differences</a> in osteoarthritis prevalence are being investigated, but researchers believe that genetics, hormonal factors and anatomical differences play a role,\" said senior author <a href=\"https://spph.ubc.ca/faculty/jacek-kopec/\">Dr. Jacek Kopek</a>, professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.\\n</p><p>The role of obesity increased during the study period. In 1990 obesity was tied to 16% of the disability due to osteoarthritis and rose to 20% in 2020.\\n</p><p>If obesity can effectively be addressed in the <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/global+population/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">global population</a>, the osteoarthritis burden would decrease by an estimated 20%, the authors said.\\n</p><p>\"Health care systems and governments have an opportunity to engage and participate in identifying vulnerable populations, addressing drivers of obesity, and developing management strategies to prevent or slow down the progression of osteoarthritis,\" said study supervisor and co-author <a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/about/people/liane-ong\">Liane Ong</a>, lead research scientist at IHME.\\n</p><p>\"The role that physical inactivity plays in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">obesity</a> and pain associated with osteoarthritis can have opposite and unintended negative cycles,\" Ong said in the release. \"For example, being physically active can prevent injuries earlier in life and can even be beneficial for someone with <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/joint+pain/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">joint pain</a>. It\\'s counterintuitive but having joint pain doesn\\'t mean we should remain sedentary.\"\\n</p><p>The study was published Aug. 21 in <i>The Lancet Rheumatology</i>.\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoarthritis\">osteoarthritis</a>.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"mt-3\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>Journal information:</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/journals/lancet-rheumatology/\"><cite>The Lancet Rheumatology</cite></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"icon_open\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<use href=\"https://medx.b-cdn.net/tmpl/v6/img/svg/sprite.svg#icon_open\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                                                    <p class=\"article-main__note mt-4\">\\n                                                Copyright © 2023 <a href=\"http://www.healthday.com/\">HealthDay</a>.

However, the study also raises concerns that law enforcement\\'s involvement in the outreach component of these programs may undermine program effectiveness.\\n                                                </p><div class=\"article-banner first-banner ads-336x280\">\\n            <!-- /4988204/MedX_Story_InText_Box -->\\n            <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\">\\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\\'); });\\n            </script>\\n            </div>\\n       </div>                                                                                \\n<p>\\n</p><p>At issue are post-overdose outreach programs, called post-overdose response teams in North Carolina, which are designed to reach out to people who have recently survived an overdose. Specifically, the goal of the programs is to connect survivors to available resources—such as harm reduction and treatment—that reduce their likelihood of overdosing again.\\n</p><p>\"We have programs and treatment tools that work to reduce harms associated with drug use, but we often struggle to connect people to these resources,\" says Alexander Walley, co-author of the study and a professor of medicine at Boston University. \"When a person overdoses, they are effectively flagging themselves as someone who could benefit from these harm reduction and treatment resources. Post-overdose outreach programs can help connect them to those resources.\"\\n</p><p>\"These programs have expanded exponentially in recent years, and are likely to become even more common since they are eligible for funding from opioid settlement funds,\" says Jennifer Carroll, an assistant professor of anthropology at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of the study. \"However, <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/best+practices/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">best practices</a> were not established for these programs until earlier this year, and we are still in the early stages of collecting evidence about how effective the programs are at actually doing what they aim to do.\"\\n</p><p>\"Our goal for this study was to get a better understanding of how these post-overdose programs are established and implemented,\" Carroll says. \"Basically, we want to know about their organizational infrastructure, why they\\'re organized this way or that way, and what seems to be helping or hurting the success of these programs.\"\\n</p><p>To that end, the researchers conducted 49 in-depth interviews with a variety of stakeholders involved in post-overdose outreach programs in Massachusetts. The study participants included 15 <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/police+officers/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">police officers</a>; 23 community partners; eight overdose survivors who received outreach services; and three family members of overdose survivors who received outreach services.\\n\\n                                            <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->\\n    </p><div class=\"w-100 mb-4 d-print-none\">\\n        <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\\n        <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0536483524803400\" data-ad-slot=\"7099578867\"></ins>\\n        <script>\\n             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n        </script>\\n    </div>                                        <p>\"We found that access to law enforcement data is essential when getting post-overdose programs off the ground, because law enforcement data about suspected overdose events is unrestricted and not subject to any privacy laws that regulate <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+information/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">medical information</a>,\" Carroll says. \"It is crucial for programs to have the ability to identify and contact people who have recently survived an overdose, and most outreach efforts are designed to rely on <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/law+enforcement+agencies/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">law enforcement agencies</a> for that purpose.\"\\n</p><p>However, the study also found that most post-overdose programs include police or deputies as part of the outreach teams that contact overdose survivors.\\n</p><p>\"Having law enforcement participate in outreach poses a variety of challenges,\" Carroll says. \"For one thing, police are being asked to participate in a program they are not trained for—they are not social workers or public health experts.\"\\n</p><p>\"For another, police are primarily tasked with enforcing local, state and federal laws; overdose survivors have broken the law by using illegal drugs, and many survivors have had negative experiences with law enforcement. Altogether, this makes overdose survivors leery of working with police, and can also put police in morally or professionally conflicted positions.\"\\n</p><p>\"In other words, post-overdose programs have a \\'police paradox\\'—relying on law enforcement for information and support, but struggling with the fact that police involvement during the outreach process makes it harder to get the necessary buy-in from survivors and meet the program\\'s overdose prevention goals,\" Carroll says.\\n</p><p>The concerns raised in this study about police involvement during the outreach process are not unfounded. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34700251/\">A 2022 study</a>, also co-authored by Carroll and Walley, found that police sometimes arrested overdose survivors flagged by overdose-response programs.\\n</p><p>\"Ultimately, these findings suggest that—if we really want to reduce overdose risks—law enforcement should not be part of the post-overdose outreach teams,\" Carroll says. \"These findings were central to establishing current best practices for outreach, but many post-overdose programs don\\'t appear to be following best practices when it comes to keeping police out of the outreach teams.\"\\n</p><p>Best practice guidance developed by this research group can be found at <a href=\"https://prontopostoverdose.org/\">prontopostoverdose.org</a>.\\n</p><p>The paper, \"The police paradox: A qualitative study of post-<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/overdose/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">overdose</a> outreach program implementation through public health-public safety partnerships in Massachusetts,\" is published in the <i>International Journal of Drug Policy</i>.\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    Jennifer J.

Whereas ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, causes progressive paralysis and death within three to five years of diagnosis, FTD most commonly affects behavior, personality and language.\\n</p><p>Both diseases are usually diagnosed in middle age or later, and yet carriers of the C9ORF72 mutation can show reductions in the size of two brain regions—the thalamic region and the frontal cortical region—decades before developing any symptoms.\\n</p><p>\"It\\'s unclear whether this reduction in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gray+matter/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">gray matter</a> arises from altered development in an embryo or from early degeneration in an adult,\" said first author Eric Hendricks, a postdoc in the Ichida Lab.\\n</p><h2>Evidence of altered development in the embryo</h2>\\n<p>Hendricks and his colleagues approached this question by taking skin or <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">blood cells</a> from patients with ALS or FTD resulting from mutations in C9ORF72, and reprogramming these cells into neural stem cells, which are the cells that form the nervous system during embryonic development.\\n</p><p>Compared to neural stem cells derived from healthy people, the neural stem cells from patients with ALS or FTD weren\\'t able to renew their population. Instead, the patient-derived neural stem cells had a tendency to prematurely differentiate into mature neurons.\\n</p><p>The patient-derived neural stem cells contained a mutant protein called poly(AP). Although poly(AP) isn\\'t fatally toxic to cells, it does impair their ability to make proteins necessary for building new cells. As a result, poly(AP) impairs neural stem cells\\' ability to renew their population.\\n</p><p>The scientists wanted to understand the consequences of a non-renewing population of neural stem cells in a living organism, so they turned to <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/laboratory+mice/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">laboratory mice</a>.\\n</p><p>In embryonic mice, mutations in C9ORF72 caused measurable developmental changes not only in their brains, but also elsewhere in their bodies. In their brains, these changes included smaller thalamic regions, as well as reduced cortical thickness. The mice also weighed 5–10% less at embryonic day 18.5.\\n</p><p>In addition, if scientists administered a drug that caused similar structural changes to the brain during <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/embryonic+development/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">embryonic development</a>, mice experienced clumsiness and other motor deficits at two months of age.\\n</p><p>\"Our findings suggest that C9ORF72 mutations impair neurodevelopment in utero in patients with ALS and FTD, and that this could potentially contribute to the onset of disease symptoms later in life,\" said Ichida.\\n</p><p>Other co-authors are Alicia M.

Recently, the SORL1 gene has received increased attention since variations in this gene have been associated with both early and late onset AD. However, little is known about how damage to SORL1 leads to disease.\\n                                                </p><div class=\"article-banner first-banner ads-336x280\">\\n            <!-- /4988204/MedX_Story_InText_Box -->\\n            <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\">\\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\\'); });\\n            </script>\\n            </div>\\n       </div>                                                                                \\n<p>\\n</p><p>Using stem cells from patients with AD, investigators from Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, found that loss of normal SORL1 function leads to a reduction in two key proteins known to be involved in AD and which play an essential role in the neurons of healthy individuals. Their results, published in <i>Cell Reports</i>, suggest a potential new strategy for AD treatment, especially for patients not responsive to existing therapies.\\n</p><p>\"Understanding the subtypes of AD is relatively new in the field of neurology research,\" said corresponding author Tracy Young-Pearse, Ph.D., of the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases. \"This is getting at a precision neurology approach, with which we can better predict which patients may be responsive to Alzheimer\\'s treatment strategies that attack <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/specific+genes/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">specific genes</a> or target the problems they cause.\"\\n</p><p>Historically, researchers have studied three potent genetic drivers of AD (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2), which are commonly mutated in hereditary, early-onset AD (AD diagnosis before age 65).\\n</p><p>Preclinical models and cell-based systems largely rely on mutations in these genes to model AD, even though in many people with late-onset (\"sporadic\") AD, a more complex interaction between genes, lifestyle, and environment determines the presentation of AD. Key neurological features of AD, including the abundance of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, also vary across individuals.\\n</p><p>Brigham researchers played a <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/leadership+role/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">leadership role</a> in understanding the molecular and <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+basis/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">genetic basis</a> for AD, including making key discoveries related to the amyloid protein. Two novel anti-amyloid therapies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have received United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated and traditional approval, respectively, but not all patients respond to these drugs, warranting other treatment options.\\n</p><p>In this new study, the researchers utilized a stem-cell based approach that examined natural genetic variability in AD patients to gain insight into an alternative pathway driving disease. The researchers used CRISPR technologies to remove the SORL1 gene from progenitor stem cells, derived from participants in two Alzheimer\\'s research cohorts, the Religious Order Studies and Rush Memory and Aging Project. They programmed the <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">stem cells</a> to differentiate into four different kinds of brain cells to examine the impact of removing SORL1 on each cell type.\\n</p><p>The most dramatic impact was seen in neurons and a \"support\" cell in the brain (astrocytes), with neurons lacking SORL1 demonstrating especially prominent reduction in the levels of two key AD proteins: APOE and CLU. Without APOE and CLU, neurons cannot properly regulate lipids, which accumulate in droplets that may impair neurons\\' abilities to communicate with each other.\\n</p><p>The researchers verified their lab-based results by examining natural genetic variation in SORL1 expression in the brain tissue of 50 members of the cohorts, finding again that lower SORL1 activity in neurons was correlated with reduced APOE and CLU in these people.\\n</p><p>The researchers are continuing to study other pathways that may lead to AD, such as those involving microglia (brain cells that perform immune functions). By using study models and techniques reflective of AD presentation in the <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/general+population/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">general population</a>, the researchers hope to identify additional biological pathways important in AD.\\n</p><p>\"Our study is one of the first with <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">human cells</a> from a large collection of individuals to try to understand the \\'molecular road\\' that starts with SORL1, which we now see converges with APOE,\" Young-Pearse said.\\n</p><p>\"Our research points to the importance of developing interventions that target these and other molecular roads to Alzheimer\\'s disease. The more we can understand subtype-specific differences in AD, the better we will be able to design rational therapeutic interventions to try to fix the problem that is primarily driving disease in each patient.\"\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    Tracy L.

But they can also switch to a more sinister role—driving the development of brain and eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and uveitis (inflammation of the eye).\\n</p><p>Under normal conditions, microglia vigilantly survey environmental changes to maintain normal retinal function. Under pathological conditions, they will respond quickly to injuries, but could also become inappropriately activated, grow in number, and migrate into surrounding tissues.\\n</p><p>\"Our understanding of microglia function comes predominantly from rodent studies due to the difficulty of sourcing <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+tissue/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">human tissue</a> and isolating the microglia from these tissues. But there are genetic and functional differences between microglia in mice and humans, so these studies may not accurately represent many human conditions,\" says lead author Wenxin Ma, a Ph.D. Biologist at the Retinal Neurophysiology Section, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, US.\\n</p><p>\"To address this concern, researchers have been growing human microglia from <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+stem+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">human stem cells</a>. We wanted to take this a step further and see if we could transplant human microglia into the mouse retina, to serve as a platform for screening therapeutic drugs as well as explore the potential of microglia transplantation as a therapy itself,\" adds senior author Wai Wong, Vice President of Retinal Disease, Janssen Research and Development LLC, California, U.S.\\n</p><p>To test their approach, the researchers grew microglia from a type of stem cell called human induced <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pluripotent+stem+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">pluripotent stem cells</a> (hiPSCs). They conducted a series of tests to check that their cultivated microglia cells functioned as typical immune cells and then transplanted them into mice retina.\\n\\n                                            <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->\\n    </p><div class=\"w-100 mb-4 d-print-none\">\\n        <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\\n        <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0536483524803400\" data-ad-slot=\"7099578867\"></ins>\\n        <script>\\n             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n        </script>\\n    </div>                                        <p>First, they used a drug to eliminate the existing population of microglial cells, and then they transplanted the new, labeled cells in their place. At four and eight months after transplantation, the human microglial cells had migrated into the retina and were well distributed, and behaving as microglia should—responding to chemical signals within the eye. Moreover, the introduction of hiPSC-microglia cells had no negative effects on the surrounding cells of the retina.\\n</p><p>Having shown that these transplanted hiPSC-microglia integrate harmoniously with the existing mouse microglia population, the team tested whether the transplanted cells had a normal immune reaction to retinal cell injury. They found that the cells behaved exactly as the resident mouse microglia—migrating into the subretinal space to be near damaged cells. This left a lower number of human microglia in their original location, but the transplanted microglia quickly replenished themselves, and stopped multiplying once back to their original numbers.\\n</p><p>An important role of microglia is to gobble up unhealthy cells in a process called phagocytosis. Not only did the transplanted microglia move into the damaged regions, they also hoovered up the damaged light-receiving cells. This further suggests that the <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/transplanted+cells/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">transplanted cells</a> mirrored normal functions of resident microglia in the eye.\\n</p><p>One limitation of the study is uncertainty around its claim that the microglia generated from hiPSCs are mature, and therefore comparable to human-derived mature microglia cells. Further work is needed, according to the <i>eLife</i> public review, to claim they are mature human microglia, such as carrying out a <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/comparative+analysis/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">comparative analysis</a> with publicly available gene expression data for primary human microglia.\\n</p><p>\"Understanding microglial cell function is essential for investigating disease mechanisms and identifying accurate targets for treating degenerative retinal diseases,\" explains senior author Wei Li, a Senior Investigator in the Retinal Neurophysiology Section, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health. \"Our model provides a new way of studying the functions of human microglia within disease mechanisms and a platform for evaluating the potential therapeutic effects of <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/microglia/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">microglia</a> cell transplants from diverse patient backgrounds.\"\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    Wenxin Ma et al, Human iPSC-derived Microglia Cells Integrated into Mouse Retina and Recapitulated Features of Endogenous Microglia Cells, <i>eLife</i> (2023).  <a data-doi=\"1\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90695.1\" target=\"_blank\">DOI: 10.7554/eLife.90695.1</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"mt-3\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>Journal information:</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/journals/elife/\"><cite>eLife</cite></a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"icon_open\" href=\"http://www.elifesciences.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<use href=\"https://medx.b-cdn.net/tmpl/v6/img/svg/sprite.svg#icon_open\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"d-inline-block text-medium my-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/partners/elife/\">eLife</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"icon_open\" href=\"https://elifesciences.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<use href=\"https://medx.b-cdn.net/tmpl/v6/img/svg/sprite.svg#icon_open\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                                                                                                        \\n                                        <!-- print only -->\\n                                        <div class=\"d-none d-print-block\">\\n                                            <div class=\"mb-4\">\\n                                                 <strong>Citation</strong>:\\n                                                 Scientists develop new therapeutic model for potentially treating incurable eye diseases (2023, August 22)\\n                                                 retrieved 23 August 2023\\n                                                 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-scientists-therapeutic-potentially-incurable-eye.html\\n                                            </div>\\n                                            <div class=\"border text-muted p-3\">\\n                                            This document is subject to copyright.

Seven locally acquired infections in Florida and one in Texas have all been reported since May, but no evidence suggests the cases in these two states are related, according to the <a href=\"https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.asp\">CDC</a>. Health officials said the Maryland patient had not traveled to those two states.\\n</p><p>\"We are taking this very seriously and will work with local and federal <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+officials/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">health officials</a> to investigate this case,\" Maryland Health Department Secretary Laura Herrera Scott said in a <a href=\"https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland-Department-of-Health-announces-positive-case-of-locally-acquired-malaria.aspx\">statement</a>.\\n</p><p>The state health department said the patient, who is hospitalized and recovering, has not traveled outside the United States recently. The patient had gone to the hospital with symptoms including fever and sweating, said David Blythe, M.D., director of the health department\\'s infectious disease division, <i>NBC News</i> reported. A mosquito may have acquired malaria from a person who had acquired it while traveling and then spread it via a bite to the Maryland patient, Blythe theorized.\\n</p><p>Malaria, a mosquito-borne illness, is rare in the United States and was considered eliminated nationally by 1951.

But only 41% of older adults who say their health is fair or poor had heard of the RSV vaccine, compared with 53% of those who rated their health as good to excellent.\\n</p><p>On the other hand, over 65% of those with a chronic health condition said they were very or somewhat interested in getting the vaccine, whether or not they had heard of it before being polled.\\n</p><p>Risk from RSV infection rises with age, and so did interest in getting vaccinated against it. In all, 70% of people in their 70s said they were very or somewhat interested in getting vaccinated, compared with 60% of those in their 60s.\\n</p><p>\"As we prepare for the first RSV season when a vaccine will be available for older adults, these early data suggest a need for public health officials, primary care providers, pharmacies and others to target their outreach and awareness-building efforts,\" said Preeti Malani, M.D., senior advisor to the poll who has training in geriatrics as well as infectious disease and is a physician at Michigan Medicine, U-M\\'s academic medical center.\\n</p><p>She added, \"We found an association between awareness and interest, with 68% of those who had heard of the vaccine saying they were very interested or somewhat interested in getting vaccinated, compared with 60% who hadn\\'t heard of the vaccine until asked by the poll team.\"\\n                                                                                \\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><div class=\"article-main__more p-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                    <p><strong>More information:</strong>\\n                                                    <a href=\"https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.healthyagingpoll.org/</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p></div>\\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"d-inline-block text-medium my-4\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProvided by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/partners/university-of-michigan/\">University of Michigan</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"icon_open\" href=\"http://www.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<use href=\"https://medx.b-cdn.net/tmpl/v6/img/svg/sprite.svg#icon_open\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n                                                                                                                        \\n                                        <!-- print only -->\\n                                        <div class=\"d-none d-print-block\">\\n                                            <div class=\"mb-4\">\\n                                                 <strong>Citation</strong>:\\n                                                 Many older adults want RSV vaccine, poll shows (2023, August 22)\\n                                                 retrieved 23 August 2023\\n                                                 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-08-older-adults-rsv-vaccine-poll.html\\n                                            </div>\\n                                            <div class=\"border text-muted p-3\">\\n                                            This document is subject to copyright.

cancer. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and high levels of estrogen promote its development. The study, published in <i>Molecular Cancer Research</i> discovered that estrogen receptor mutations found in endometrial cancers cause large changes in endometrial cancer cells.\\n                                                </p><div class=\"article-banner first-banner ads-336x280\">\\n            <!-- /4988204/MedX_Story_InText_Box -->\\n            <div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\">\\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'div-gpt-ad-1450190541376-1\\'); });\\n            </script>\\n            </div>\\n       </div>                                                                                \\n<p>\\n</p><p>Estrogen is a reproductive hormone that binds and activates estrogen receptors. Cancer can cause estrogen receptors to remain in a state of constant activity. That increases shedding of the endometrial lining.\\n</p><p>\"Our goal was to characterize estrogen receptor mutations in endometrial <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">cancer</a> to see how they affected gene expression, along with how these mutations made cells more aggressive and fast-growing,\" says Zannel Blanchard, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow at Huntsman Cancer Institute and lead investigator on the study. \"We found that the mutations caused large changes in <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">gene expression</a> and cellular behavior.\"\\n</p><p>The team used their findings to identify potential treatments for <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/endometrial+cancers/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">endometrial cancers</a> with high levels of estrogen receptor activity. They found that inhibitors of CDK9, a protein that works with <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/estrogen/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">estrogen</a> receptors, were effective at reducing the growth and aggressiveness of endometrial cancer cells.\\n</p><p>\"Besides surgery to treat endometrial cancer, there\\'s only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating primary endometrial cancer, and it was approved in the 1970s,\" says Jay Gertz, Ph.D., the senior author and researcher at Huntsman Cancer Institute and associate professor of oncological sciences at the University of Utah. \"Our results help us to really start moving toward personalized—or precision—medicine for endometrial cancer.\"\\n</p><p>The study was presented to a breast and gynecologic cancer research advocacy group made up of patients. Participants volunteer their time and meet once a month at Huntsman Cancer Institute.\\n</p><p>\"We can write support letters to help with upcoming research grants and offer a patient perspective to researchers,\" says Deb Jordan, an endometrial cancer patient at Huntsman Cancer Institute and advocacy group participant. \"We also get to hear about the ongoing research at Huntsman Cancer Institute. That puts my mind at ease, to learn all that is being done for endometrial cancer.\"\\n</p><p>\"It\\'s exciting because the study suggests that there may be more options for endometrial cancer patients,\" says Blanchard. \"There\\'s more going on when you look deeper and we get to share these findings with patients who have been through treatment.\"\\n</p><p>Gertz says the <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment+options/\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"textTag\">treatment options</a> for endometrial cancer are limited and patients play an important role in inspiring researchers to find new therapies.
