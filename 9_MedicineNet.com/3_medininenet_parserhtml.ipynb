      "{'title': 'Hedge Mustard', 'content': '\\n\\n   Overview\\n\\n  Hedge mustard is a plant. The leaves, stems, and flowers are used to make medicine.\\n\\nDespite serious safety concerns, people take hedge mustard to treat urinary tract diseases, coughs, chronic bronchitis, and swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder.\\n\\n \\n\\nHedge mustard is also used as a gargle or mouthwash.\\n\\nBe careful not to confuse hedge mustard with other types of mustards such as black mustard, brown mustard, white mustard, Indian mustard, and Chinese mustard.How does it work?Hedge mustard contains vitamin C and mustard oil. There isn\\'t enough information to know how hedge mustard might work as a medicine.\\n\\n   Uses & Effectiveness\\n\\n  Insufficient Evidence to Rate Effectiveness for...Urinary tract diseases.\\n\\nCoughs.\\n\\nChronic bronchitis.\\n\\nSwelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder.\\n\\nUse as a gargle or mouthwash.\\n\\nOther conditions.Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate (detailed description of each of the ratings).\\n\\n   Side Effects\\n\\n  The flowering above-ground parts of hedge mustard are considered UNSAFE to take by mouth. Hedge mustard can cause serious side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and heart rhythm disorders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       \\n\\n   Special Precautions & Warnings\\n\\n  UNSAFE\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: It\\'s UNSAFE to use hedge mustard. It can affect the heart and cause other harm. Don\\'t use it.\\n\\n \\n\\nHeart disease: Hedge mustard contains chemicals called cardiac glycosides that might make heart disease worse or interfere with treatment. Avoid use.\\n\\n   Interactions\\n\\n  Digoxin (Lanoxin)MajorDigoxin (Lanoxin) helps the heart beat more strongly. Hedge mustard also seems to affect the heart. Taking hedge mustard along with digoxin (Lanoxin) can increase the effects and side effects of digoxin (Lanoxin). Do not take hedge mustard if you are taking digoxin (Lanoxin) without talking to your health care professional.Antibiotics (Macrolide antibiotics)ModerateHedge mustard can affect the heart. Some antibiotics might increase how much hedge mustard the body absorbs. Taking hedge mustard along with some antibiotics might increase the effects and side effects of hedge mustard.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome antibiotics called macrolide antibiotics include erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin.Antibiotics (Tetracycline antibiotics)ModerateTaking tetracyclines with hedge mustard might increase the chance of side effects from hedge mustard.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome tetracyclines include demeclocycline (Declomycin), minocycline (Minocin), and tetracycline (Achromycin).QuinineModerateHedge mustard can affect the heart. Quinine can also affect the heart. Taking quinine along with hedge mustard might cause serious heart problems.Stimulant laxativesModerateHedge mustard can affect the heart. The heart uses potassium. Laxatives called stimulant laxatives can decrease potassium levels in the body. Low potassium levels can increase the chance of side effects from hedge mustard.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome stimulant laxatives include bisacodyl (Correctol, Dulcolax), cascara, castor oil (Purge), senna (Senokot), and others.Water pills (Diuretic drugs)ModerateHedge mustard might affect the heart. \"Water pills\" can decrease potassium in the body. Low potassium levels can also affect the heart and increase the risk of side effects from hedge mustard.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome \"water pills\" that can deplete potassium include chlorothiazide (Diuril), chlorthalidone (Thalitone), furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, HydroDiuril, Microzide), and others.\\n\\n   Dosing\\n\\n  The appropriate dose of hedge mustard depends on several factors such as the user\\'s age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for hedge mustard. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.'}\n"
